## This Session's Focus: The Identity Myth

**The Belief They Hold:**
"I'm just someone who gets addicted easily. I have an addictive personality. I'm different from people who can quit. This is who I am."

**The Truth You're Guiding Them Toward:**
There's no such thing as an "addictive personality" when it comes to nicotine. Nicotine is addictive for everyone—that's how it works. They're not uniquely weak or flawed. They're experiencing exactly what the drug is designed to do. Believing they're "just an addictive person" gives them an excuse to stay stuck and makes quitting feel impossible. But it's a myth. Everyone can quit.

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- "Before you started using nicotine, did you see yourself as someone with an addictive personality?"
- "Are there other things you've stopped doing without much trouble? (Hobbies, relationships, foods you used to love?)"
- "Do you think non-users don't get addicted because they're stronger, or because they never started?"
- "If someone told you 'I can't quit because I'm just a nicotine person,' what would you think?"
- "What would change if you stopped seeing this as part of your identity and started seeing it as something that happened to you?"

**The Reframe Moment:**
Help them see that nicotine addiction isn't a character flaw or a personality trait—it's a predictable chemical response. Anyone who uses nicotine regularly gets addicted. Period. The idea of an "addictive personality" is often a story we tell ourselves to explain why we're stuck, but it's not scientifically accurate. They're not broken. They're just addicted to an addictive substance, like millions of others. And just like millions of others, they can quit.

**Watch For:**
- Listing other things they're "addicted" to (coffee, sugar, phone) - validate that those might be habits, but nicotine is uniquely powerful and uniquely pointless
- Family history as proof - gently reframe: "Your family members used nicotine, which is addictive. That's not genetic destiny—it's exposure"
- Fear of losing identity - if they've built their sense of self around being "a vaper" or "a smoker," quitting can feel like losing a piece of themselves. Validate that and explore who they are without it.

**Analogies That Help:**
- The trap isn't personal: If you step in a bear trap, it's not because you have a "trap-prone personality." It's because you stepped in a trap. Nicotine is the trap.
- The virus analogy: If you catch a virus, you're not "a virus person." You're someone who got infected. Nicotine is the same—it's something that happened to you, not who you are.
- The label trap: If you label yourself "an addict," you're giving yourself a role to live up to. What if you're just "someone who used to use nicotine"?

**Completion Signal:**
When they can clearly articulate: "I see that I'm not fundamentally different or broken—I'm just someone who got addicted to an addictive substance, and I can quit like anyone else" and they seem hopeful (not defeated), the session is complete.
