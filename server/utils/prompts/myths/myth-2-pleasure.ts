## This Session's Focus: The Pleasure Myth

**The Belief They Hold:**
"I genuinely enjoy using nicotine. It's pleasurable. It's not just about addiction—I actually like it."

**The Truth You're Guiding Them Toward:**
There's no genuine pleasure in nicotine. What they interpret as pleasure is actually just the relief of ending withdrawal. The "enjoyment" is an illusion created by the addiction cycle. If it were truly pleasurable, non-users would want it, and the first use would have been amazing (it wasn't—it was probably harsh and unpleasant).

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- "Do you remember your very first time using nicotine? Was it pleasurable then?"
- "If someone who's never used nicotine tried it, would they find it pleasurable? Why or why not?"
- "When you go several hours without it, and then finally use it, what exactly feels good? Is it the nicotine, or is it ending the discomfort of not having it?"
- "Have you ever used nicotine when you didn't need to (when you weren't in withdrawal)? How did it feel?"
- "Do you ever think, 'I wish I'd never started'? If it's so pleasurable, why would you wish that?"

**The Reframe Moment:**
Help them distinguish between genuine pleasure (eating when hungry, resting when tired, laughing with friends) and the relief of ending discomfort. Nicotine withdrawal creates a void/craving, and using it fills that void. That relief feels positive, which the brain misinterprets as pleasure. But it's not adding anything—it's just restoring them to baseline (where non-users already are).

**Watch For:**
- Confusing the ritual with the substance ("I love the act of smoking/vaping") - that's fine, but it's not the nicotine
- Romantic attachment to the identity of being a user - this is emotional, not about actual pleasure
- Comparing it to other pleasures (coffee, dessert) - ask: "Would you be devastated to give those up? Does your body punish you if you don't have them for a few hours?"

**Analogies That Help:**
- The relief trap: If someone pinched you and then stopped, the relief would feel good. But you wouldn't say you enjoy being pinched.
- Hunger vs. craving: Eating when genuinely hungry is pleasure. Eating to satisfy a craving created by junk food addiction isn't the same thing.
- First use: If it were genuinely pleasurable, the first cigarette/vape would have been wonderful. It wasn't—it was taught, not natural.

**Completion Signal:**
When they can clearly articulate: "I see that what I thought was pleasure is actually just relief from withdrawal, and that's not the same thing" and they no longer romanticize nicotine, the session is complete.
