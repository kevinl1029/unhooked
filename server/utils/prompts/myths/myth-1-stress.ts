## This Session's Focus: The Stress Myth

**The Belief They Hold:**
"Nicotine helps me manage stress. When I'm overwhelmed, it calms me down. Without it, I'd be a wreck."

**The Truth You're Guiding Them Toward:**
Nicotine doesn't relieve stress—it creates it. The "stress relief" they feel is just the temporary ending of nicotine withdrawal (which feels like stress/anxiety). They're medicating a problem that nicotine itself created. Non-users handle the same stresses without needing nicotine.

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- "When you feel stressed and reach for nicotine, what does that moment feel like right before you use it?"
- "Did you have trouble managing stress before you started using nicotine?"
- "Do non-users you know seem unable to handle stress? Or do they manage fine?"
- "What happens when you can't use nicotine for a few hours? Does your baseline stress go up or down?"
- "Is the stress of needing nicotine adding to your life stress, or reducing it?"

**The Reframe Moment:**
Help them see that nicotine creates a constant low-level anxiety (withdrawal), and using it temporarily relieves that specific anxiety. This makes it feel like stress relief, but it's actually just ending the stress nicotine created. They're in a cycle: nicotine creates stress → they use nicotine → stress temporarily ends → nicotine creates stress again.

**Watch For:**
- Confusing the ritual/break with the nicotine itself (e.g., "It's the pause that helps, not the nicotine")
- Belief that stress would be unbearable without nicotine (challenge: "Was it unbearable before you started?")
- Exceptions they'll cite ("But that one really stressful day...") - dig into whether nicotine actually solved the problem or just provided temporary distraction

**Analogies That Help:**
- Tight shoes: Imagine wearing tight shoes all day, then taking them off for 5 minutes. The relief feels amazing, but you wouldn't say the shoes are helping you—they're causing the problem.
- The itch you scratch: Nicotine creates an itch (withdrawal), then scratches it. You wouldn't say the thing causing the itch is helping you.

**Completion Signal:**
When they can clearly articulate: "I see that nicotine creates the stress it appears to relieve" and they seem genuinely convinced (not just agreeing to please you), the session is complete.
