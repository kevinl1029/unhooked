      <p class="section-text">You've tried before. Maybe patches, maybe cold turkey, maybe sheer force of will. And when it didn't stick, you blamed yourself.</p>
      <p class="section-text">But here's what nobody told you: nicotine's physical grip is weak. The withdrawal is mild—comparable to a slight hunger pang that passes in seconds. That's not what's keeping you hooked.</p>
      <p class="pull-quote">What keeps you reaching for it isn't physical. It's psychological.</p>

        <p class="stacked-line">It's the beliefs.</p>
        <p class="stacked-line">That it relaxes you.</p>
        <p class="stacked-line">That it helps you focus.</p>
        <p class="stacked-line">That you'll always want it.</p>
        <p class="stacked-line">That quitting means suffering.</p>

      <p class="section-text">These aren't truths. They're illusions—ones that nicotine taught you to believe. And once you see them clearly, they lose their power.</p>
