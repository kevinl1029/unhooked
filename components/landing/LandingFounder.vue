      <h2 class="section-title">Why I built this</h2>
      <p class="section-text">I vaped for years. It started casually. Then it was always there—before meetings, after meals, during every break. I didn't think of myself as "addicted." I just needed it.</p>
      <p class="section-text">Every attempt ended the same way—a few days of white-knuckling, then that thought: "just one."</p>
      <p class="section-text">I read about the psychology. I understood it logically—that nicotine doesn't relieve stress, it creates it. That the "focus" is just withdrawal ending. It all made sense.</p>
      <p class="section-text">But understanding it wasn't enough.</p>
      <p class="section-text">What finally worked was journaling. Writing through <em>my</em> triggers. <em>My</em> beliefs. The specific moments when I reached for it. Once I personalized it—made it about my life, not abstract theory—everything clicked. The wanting just stopped and so did my cravings.</p>
      <p class="section-text">That was three years ago. I haven't had a craving since. Not because I'm resisting—because there's nothing to resist.</p>
      <p class="pull-quote">Not through discipline. Through clarity.</p>
      <p class="section-text">But it took years. On and off, whenever I could make myself sit down and write. It wasn't a habit I could stick to—just something I returned to when I was frustrated enough.</p>
      <p class="section-text">I built Unhooked so you don't have to do it that way. The conversations do what journaling did for me—help you see <em>your</em> illusions, in <em>your</em> life—but in weeks instead of years.</p>
