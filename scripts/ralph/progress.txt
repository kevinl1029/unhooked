## Codebase Patterns
- Nuxt auto-imports cause duplicate warnings when types/functions are exported from multiple files
- Source of truth for LLM task types should be `server/utils/llm/task-types.ts`
- Use `npm run build` to verify type errors since `npx nuxi typecheck` requires tsconfig.json at root
- `npm run postinstall` (nuxt prepare) generates `.nuxt/tsconfig.json` and shows duplicate import warnings

## 2026-01-26 00:10 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Removed duplicate `CeremonyNarrativeInput`, `CeremonyNarrativeOutput`, and `JourneySegment` interfaces from `ceremony-narrative.ts`
  - Updated `task-types.ts` with correct ceremony type definitions:
    - `CeremonyNarrativeInput.selectedMoments` now uses `CapturedMoment[]` (was `CeremonyMomentSelection`)
    - Added `originSummary` field to `CeremonyNarrativeInput`
    - `CeremonyNarrativeOutput.segments` uses `JourneySegment[]` (was `audioSegments: AudioSegment[]`)
    - Added `JourneySegment` interface with correct fields
  - Removed obsolete `CeremonyMomentSelection` and `AudioSegment` types
  - `ceremony-narrative.ts` now imports types from `task-types.ts`
- Files changed:
  - `server/utils/llm/task-types.ts`
  - `server/utils/llm/tasks/ceremony-narrative.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The previous `CeremonyMomentSelection` type was never used correctly - the actual implementation uses flat `CapturedMoment[]`
  - Re-exporting types from task files causes Nuxt auto-import duplicate warnings - don't re-export, just import
  - US-003 criteria about ceremony types are now mostly complete from this work

## 2026-01-26 00:20 - US-002
- What was implemented:
  - Updated `IllusionCheatSheetEntry` in `task-types.ts` to use camelCase fields matching actual usage:
    - `illusionKey`, `name`, `illusion`, `truth`, `userInsight`, `insightMomentId`
  - Renamed `IllusionsCheatSheet` to `CheatSheetData` with `entries` array and `generatedAt` field
  - Updated `validateCheatSheet()` to validate the new camelCase structure
  - Updated `cheat-sheet-generator.ts` to import `IllusionCheatSheetEntry` and `CheatSheetData` from `task-types.ts`
  - Removed duplicate type definitions from `cheat-sheet-generator.ts`
  - Updated tests in `task-types.test.ts` to use new camelCase field names
- Files changed:
  - `server/utils/llm/task-types.ts`
  - `server/utils/ceremony/cheat-sheet-generator.ts`
  - `tests/unit/llm/task-types.test.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The original `task-types.ts` had snake_case fields that didn't match actual usage in `cheat-sheet-generator.ts` and `toolkit.vue`
  - When consolidating types, always check the UI components to see what field names are actually expected
  - Removing `export type { ... }` re-exports fixes Nuxt auto-import duplicate warnings

## 2026-01-26 00:35 - US-003
- What was implemented:
  - Verified that all acceptance criteria were already satisfied by US-001 and US-002
  - No code changes required - this was a verification story
  - Confirmed `npm run build` passes with all type definitions correct
- Files changed:
  - None (verification only)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-001 and US-002 addressed all the type definition issues that US-003 was created to track
  - When planning user stories, check for overlap - sometimes earlier stories fully satisfy later ones

## 2026-01-26 00:45 - US-004
- What was implemented:
  - Removed `selectCeremonyMoments` and `generateCeremonyNarrative` re-exports from `server/utils/llm/index.ts`
  - Added comment explaining why these are not re-exported (to avoid Nuxt auto-import duplicates)
  - Updated `server/api/ceremony/prepare.get.ts` to import `selectCeremonyMoments` from `tasks/ceremony-select`
  - Updated `server/api/ceremony/generate-journey.post.ts` to import both functions from their source files
- Files changed:
  - `server/utils/llm/index.ts`
  - `server/api/ceremony/prepare.get.ts`
  - `server/api/ceremony/generate-journey.post.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - To avoid Nuxt auto-import duplicate warnings, don't re-export functions from index.ts - import directly from source
  - The pattern of re-exporting from index.ts for convenience conflicts with Nuxt's auto-import system
  - Other task functions still have this issue (moment-detection, story-summarization, etc.) - could be cleaned up similarly

## 2026-01-26 01:00 - US-005
- What was implemented:
  - Fixed `checkExistingProgress()` to properly call `fetchStatus()` before accessing `status.value`
  - Added `isCheckingStatus` ref to track the initial status check loading state
  - Added loading indicator in template that shows while checking ceremony progress
  - Added redirect to `/dashboard` if ceremony is already completed
  - Maintains existing behavior of loading journey if reflective_journey artifact exists
- Files changed:
  - `pages/ceremony.vue`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `useUserStatus()` composable requires calling `fetchStatus()` before accessing `status.value`
  - Always add a loading state when doing async operations on mount to prevent flash of incorrect content
  - Use `navigateTo()` for programmatic navigation in Nuxt 3
