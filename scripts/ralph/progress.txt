# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Tue Jan 27 14:17:25 EST 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- **Illusion Keys:** Database uses 'stress_relief', 'pleasure', 'willpower', 'focus', 'identity' (NOT 'stress', etc.)
- **API Patterns:** Use `serverSupabaseUser()` for auth check, `serverSupabaseServiceRole()` for queries
- **Conviction Scores:** Stored in user_story table as {illusionKey}_conviction (e.g., stress_relief_conviction)
- **Testing:** Run `npm run build` for typecheck (no separate typecheck script), `npm run test:unit` for tests
- **Reinforcement Sessions:** Two types - 'reinforcement' (illusion-specific) and 'boost' (generic post-ceremony support)
- **Session Context:** buildSessionContext in context-builder.ts returns string (prompt overlay) for reinforcement/boost, PersonalizationContext for core sessions
- **Assessment Reuse:** Existing conviction assessment logic in server/utils/llm/tasks/conviction-assessment.ts works for both core and reinforcement sessions
- **Prompt Overlays:** Reinforcement prompts stored in server/utils/prompts/reinforcement-prompts.ts with buildReinforcementPrompt/buildBoostPrompt helpers
- **Frontend Components:** Existing components in components/ use .glass, .btn-primary, .rounded-card, .shadow-card from assets/css/main.css
- **Dashboard Structure:** pages/dashboard.vue has multiple states: post-ceremony, ceremony-ready, in-progress, not-started

## Tue Jan 27 14:21:00 EST 2026 - US-001
- Implemented GET /api/dashboard/moments endpoint
- Files changed:
  - server/api/dashboard/moments.get.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Illusion keys in database: 'stress_relief', 'pleasure', 'willpower', 'focus', 'identity'
  - Conviction scores stored in user_story table with pattern: {illusionKey}_conviction (e.g., stress_relief_conviction)
  - Completed illusions tracked in user_progress.illusions_completed as array of integers (1-5)
  - Completion timestamps found in conversations table with session_type='core' and session_completed=true
  - Used weighted random selection: confidence_score * recencyMultiplier where recencyMultiplier exponentially increases over 14 days since last_used_at
  - Build passes with `npm run build` (no separate typecheck script)
  - Pre-existing test failures in ceremony/journey-contract.test.ts are unrelated to reinforcement sessions
---

## Tue Jan 27 14:45:00 EST 2026 - US-002
- Implemented POST /api/reinforcement/start endpoint
- Files changed:
  - server/api/reinforcement/start.post.ts (new)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true for US-002)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Endpoint handles two distinct session types: 'reinforcement' (illusion-specific) and 'boost' (generic, post-ceremony only)
  - Illusion keys in database are: 'stress_relief', 'pleasure', 'willpower', 'focus', 'identity' (NOT 'stress')
  - The PRD acceptance criteria specified 'stress' but database uses 'stress_relief' - implementation uses database keys
  - Boost sessions require ceremony_completed_at to be non-null (user completed all 5 illusions)
  - Weighted moment selection reuses same algorithm from US-001: confidence_score * recencyMultiplier
  - When moment_id is provided for anchored sessions, update last_used_at timestamp for that moment
  - Context building varies by session type: reinforcement gets illusion-specific data, boost gets all conviction scores + top 3 moments per illusion (15 max)
  - Days since last session calculated from most recent completed_at for the illusion
  - Build passes with `npm run build` (same pre-existing warnings as before)
---

## Tue Jan 27 15:00:00 EST 2026 - US-003
- No implementation needed - functionality already exists in server/api/reinforcement/start.post.ts
- Files changed:
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true for US-003)
  - scripts/ralph/progress.txt (this file)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-003 was actually completed as part of US-002 implementation
  - The generic boost session handling (lines 62-151 in start.post.ts) fulfills all US-003 acceptance criteria
  - When reviewing PRD stories, check if functionality already exists before starting implementation
  - All US-003 acceptance criteria verified: handles { reason: 'generic_boost' }, returns 403 if ceremony not complete, creates 'boost' session type, includes all conviction scores and top 3 moments per illusion
  - Build passes with `npm run build` (verified typecheck passes)
---

## Tue Jan 27 15:15:00 EST 2026 - US-004
- Implemented POST /api/reinforcement/assess endpoint
- Files changed:
  - server/api/reinforcement/assess.post.ts (new)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true for US-004)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Reused existing conviction assessment logic from server/utils/llm/tasks/conviction-assessment.ts
  - Assessment process mirrors core sessions: fetch conversation transcript, run LLM assessment, store results
  - Added shift_quality classification: 'new_insight' (new moments captured), 'deepened' (conviction increased), 'restored' (maintained high level), 'still_struggling' (conviction dropped/low)
  - Key insight update logic: only update if new insights emerged in this session (check captured_moments for session)
  - User_story fields updated: {illusionKey}_conviction, {illusionKey}_resistance_notes, {illusionKey}_key_insight_id (if better insight)
  - Conviction assessments stored in conviction_assessments table with illusion_layer=null for reinforcement sessions
  - Delta calculation: assessment.newConviction - previousConviction (from user_story)
  - Build passes with `npm run build`
---

## Tue Jan 27 15:30:00 EST 2026 - US-005
- Implemented reinforcement system prompts and extended context builder
- Files changed:
  - server/utils/prompts/reinforcement-prompts.ts (new)
  - server/utils/personalization/context-builder.ts (extended)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes: true for US-005)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Created REINFORCEMENT_MODE_OVERLAY and BOOST_MODE_OVERLAY constants with detailed AI instructions
  - Reinforcement overlay focuses on reconnection (not re-teaching): open with anchor moment, explore current triggers, use user's own previous insights
  - Boost overlay is open-ended support: listen first, identify relevant illusion naturally, apply existing knowledge to current situation
  - Added buildReinforcementPrompt and buildBoostPrompt helper functions for dynamic placeholder replacement
  - Extended buildSessionContext to detect session_type and return string (prompt overlay) for reinforcement/boost instead of PersonalizationContext
  - Context builder now accepts optional sessionData parameter for anchor moments and conviction scores
  - Used dynamic import for reinforcement-prompts to avoid circular dependencies
  - Prompt structure mirrors existing illusion prompts: clear sections, conversation guidelines, completion signals
  - Build passes with `npm run build`
---

## Iteration Summary - Backend Complete
- **Completed:** US-001 through US-005 (all backend API work)
- **Remaining:** US-006 through US-021 (all frontend UI components)
- **Status:** Backend foundation is complete and ready for frontend development
- **Next Steps:**
  - US-006: Create ProgressCarousel.vue component (complex carousel with navigation, touch support)
  - Remaining stories are all Vue components and page integrations
  - All API endpoints tested with typecheck (npm run build passes)
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - GET /api/dashboard/moments - moment selection for dashboard cards
  - POST /api/reinforcement/start - starts reinforcement or boost sessions
  - POST /api/reinforcement/assess - conviction assessment after reinforcement sessions
  - Reinforcement prompt overlays in server/utils/prompts/reinforcement-prompts.ts
  - Extended buildSessionContext to handle all session types

## $(date '+%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Z %Y') - US-006
- Implemented ProgressCarousel.vue component with full carousel functionality
- Files changed:
  - components/dashboard/ProgressCarousel.vue (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Component follows existing design patterns: .glass, .btn-primary, .rounded-card, .shadow-card from assets/css/main.css
  - Uses lucide-vue-next icons (Check, Lock, RefreshCw) consistently with other components
  - Carousel uses CSS transform scale for size differences: focused (scale-100), adjacent (scale-75), far (scale-50)
  - Transition duration: 300ms ease-out for carousel movement, 200ms for hover effects
  - Illusion data structure includes: number, name, key, description, status ('completed'|'current'|'locked')
  - Status determined from props: illusionOrder, illusionsCompleted (array), currentIllusion (number)
  - Revisit badge only shows for completed illusions when focused
  - Action section uses Vue Transition with fade mode for smooth content changes
  - Desktop arrow buttons positioned absolutely with translate transforms, hidden on mobile with md: responsive classes
  - Progress dots use width animation (w-2 to w-6) to indicate focus
  - Build passes with `npm run build`
---

## $(date '+%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Z %Y') - US-007, US-008, US-009
- Added touch/swipe support to ProgressCarousel.vue
- US-008 (Revisit Badge) and US-009 (Action Section) were already implemented in US-006
- Files changed:
  - components/dashboard/ProgressCarousel.vue (updated)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated passes for US-007, US-008, US-009)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Touch handlers: touchstart stores clientX, touchmove prevents scroll if horizontal swipe detected (>10px), touchend checks if delta exceeds 50px threshold
  - Swipe left (negative delta) navigates next, swipe right (positive delta) navigates previous
  - Touch prevention strategy: only preventDefault in touchmove if horizontal swipe is detected to preserve vertical scrolling
  - Arrow buttons already used `hidden md:flex` responsive classes to hide on mobile
  - Realized US-008 and US-009 were completed as part of US-006 - component already had revisit badge and action section
  - Build passes with `npm run build`
